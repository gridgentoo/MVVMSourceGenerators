# MVVMSourceGenerators

Imagine a world where you never had to raise another property changed event or write another IComand. Well, those days are here with the new .NET Community Toolkit, which introduces brand new source generators and helper classes to enable you to write super minimal code. I break down everything you need to know about the toolkit, how to use it, and why it is awesome!
